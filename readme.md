Let's see how this goes.
Right now I just want to revise basic skills or learn required ones.

Also going to try my best to not use AI for this project.
For the coding that is, not for the writing.

Right now, its just reviewing and looking into what can be done.

todo:

- [] Need to explore how event loops and go routines work.
- [] more on redis queue
- [] writing benchmarks and metrics
